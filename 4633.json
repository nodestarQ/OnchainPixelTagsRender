    "description": "The bear market hit us hard, some of us left the space, the remaining ones had to adapt and improvise. Welcome to the place where people shilled shitcoins to their family and friends, invested all their life savings into a rug pull and quit their job to work in web3, welcome to the NFT investrs Club. Always remember: Hard times create strong clowns, strong clowns create good floors, good floors create weak clowns, weak clowns create apes.",
